# Coding Interview Practice

This repository will contain my solutions to coding interview questions by Byte by Byte. As well as some notes regarding how coding interviews should be done properly.

## Notes 

1. Never be afraid to ask for clarifications
   - Any aspect of the problem that may seem unclear or confusing, ask ofr help. 
2. Clarify the constraints of the problem
   - Can N ever be negative? 
   - Can I assume that X will never be greater than string A?
